## **Docs / Wikis**
I try to document the code as I go (not to forget stuff), it should kind-of readable and understandable.  
For questions about how something works or how to use it, please search through this repo, or just ask.  
When all the official developer docs are finished, they will be available somewhere [on this page](https://docs.k2vr.tech/).
